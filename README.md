## Summary
### Drawback
The main drawback of this webpage is there is no drop-down menu within the search fields. This would be helpful, because an unfamiliar user would not have to guess which cities, states, dates, etc., are listed within the dataset.

### Recommendations for Further Development
- Creating a filter button for the table would make the user interface more concise.
- An interactive map detailing all locations where UFOs have been spotted could help the page become more dynamic.
